# GrievanceGo

Finalized idea: Platform to raise issues with their elected/appointed representatives, and track their resolutions.

Milestone 1: Come up with high level design (low-fid and high -fid) of how the platform is going to be.

Milestone 2: Build the Frontend pages and components from the design, using react.

Milestone 3: Build the backend using MERN stack, and integrate with frontend.

Milestone 4: Add in fit and finish to the product, and continue iterating.
